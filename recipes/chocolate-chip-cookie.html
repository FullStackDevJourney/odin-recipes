    <p>This is the best chocolate chip cookies recipe ever! No funny ingredients, no chilling time, etc. Just a simple, straightforward, amazingly delicious, doughy yet still fully cooked, chocolate chip cookie that turns out perfectly every single time!</p>
    <br />
    <h2><em>Ingredients for the Chocolate chip cookie</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Whole milk.</b> 2% milk and half and half both work well in this recipe.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs.</b> There are no substitutions for eggs.
        </li>
        <li><b>Pure vanilla extract.</b> I prefer that our crepes have a rich, vanilla flavor. You can reduce the amount or add in other extracts (almond, orange, etc.) to change the flavors. Vanilla bean paste or the seeds from one vanilla bean can be used in place of extract.</li>
        <li><b>All-purpose flour.</b> I donâ€™t suggest substituting the flour, although bread flour does work well.</li>
        <li><b>Granulated sugar.</b> honey can be used in place of granulated sugar.</li>
        <li><b>Chocolate chips.</b> normal chocolate can be used and cut in smaller pieces</li>
    </ul>
